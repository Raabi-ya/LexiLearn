LexiLearn, an innovative Software Development Group Project.

LexiLearn is a web based application designed to enhance the English reading skills of dyslexic children.

The high school dropout rates highlights the critical need for personalized assistance due to the lack of awareness, leading to limited educational support and facing academic challenges.
 
Focusing on their reading disability, we offer a personalized web application with gamified features inclusive of motivational feedback by both text and speech, developing a dyslexic friendly platform.
